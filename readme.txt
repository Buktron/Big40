big40main_04.c
tests
 - args
 - fibBig40(n from small to large)

 - prints big40Rating()

Any of these "big40 mains" can be compiled
and linked with the submitted big40.c using
the following command:
 gcc big40main-0x.c b40.c -o b40-0x

where the output of the compiler will be the
executable named b40-0x.

Substitute the x with 1 -> 4 and all the minimal
tests will have been run.
